# spotify200-project
This README documents the steps followed in conducting an EDA on a Spotify dataset using Python, with a focus on understanding song features, artist nationalities, and temporal trends in music preferences.

The work was carried out mainly around exploratory analysis, then with linear regression models (with categorical variables and characteristics of the songs) and finally a small analysis was carried out around time series.
